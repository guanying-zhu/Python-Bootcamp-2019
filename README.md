# Python-Bootcamp-2019

These are materials for the Erdos Institute Code programming bootcamp, taking place May 2019 at The Ohio State University.

The course is designed for graduate students and postdocs in quantitative fields, assuming no prior experience in Python or coding in general. Please see the syllabus for a more detailed description of the course.

For the first two weeks, the main course material will be contained in Jupyter notebooks. These are written by me, but will borrow heavily from material created by other people involved in the bootcamp:
